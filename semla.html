    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Buns</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups of warm milk (70-80 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Fillings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>5 ounces marzipan</li>
        <li>2 cups whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the buns: Whisk milk, butter, and eggs together in a large bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top; let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift 5 cups flour, 1/2 cup sugar, cardamon, and salt into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>When yeast has softened, stir flour mixture into milk mixture to form a soft dough. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, and allow to rise in a warm place for 30 minutes. Lightly grease baking sheets; set aside.</li>
        <li>Sift 1 cup flour and baking powder together. Stir into risen dough, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Shape into 16 balls (or 24 if you'd like smaller semla) and place onto prepared baking sheets. Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and the center is firm, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool buns on a wire rack to room temperature.</li>
        <li>For the fillings: Once cool, cut a slice about 1/2-inch thick off of the top of each bun and set aside. Scoop or cut out the center of the buns, leaving a shell about 1/2-inch thick. Tear the removed bread into small pieces and place into a bowl. Moisten the bread with milk, then mix in marzipan until smooth. Add additional milk if needed until the marzipan filling is nearly as soft as pudding; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until frothy. Add 2 tablespoons sugar gradually, continuing to beat until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Fill each shell with a spoonful of marzipan filling. Pipe whipped cream on top of filling to 1/2 inch over the top of each bun. Replace the tops onto the buns; dust with confectioner's sugar before serving.</li>
    </ol>
